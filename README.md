## Running the Project in a Development Environment
This guide will help you set up and run the project in a development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Start the Project in a Development Container
To begin, initiate the project within a development container. This environment is designed to isolate and manage the project's dependencies.

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`

3. Start the Client
Once the dependencies are installed, start the client application by running: `npm run start`This command will launch the client interface in development mode.

4. Launch in Debugging Mode
Finally, to run the backend service, execute launcher.py in debugging mode. This allows you to track and debug the application's behavior in real-time. 

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up and run the project in a development environment. Happy coding!
